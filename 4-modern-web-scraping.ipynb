El objetivo es raspar datos de películas, procesar el código HTML y transformarlo en datos tabulares para un análisis más detallado.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Crear objeto `BeautifulSoup`: Importe '`BeautifulSoup`' de 'bs4' y cree un objeto con el contenido de la página, utilizando el analizador 'html.parser'.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Extracción de datos: Utilice selectores CSS y métodos de `BeautifulSoup`, como 'find' y 'find_all', para localizar y extraer información relevante, como el título, la fecha de lanzamiento, la calificación y otros detalles de las películas.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Creación de un DataFrame: Importe 'pandas' y cree un DataFrame vacío con las columnas deseadas. Itere sobre los elementos extraídos y almacene la información en el DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Limpieza y preprocesamiento: Realice la limpieza de datos necesaria para eliminar caracteres no deseados y formatear adecuadamente los datos, como convertir las calificaciones en números decimales y las fechas en objetos datetime.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Análisis y exportación: Ahora que tiene un DataFrame limpio y bien estructurado, puede realizar análisis adicionales, visualizaciones o exportar los datos a un archivo CSV o Excel.\n",
        "\n",
        "Siguiendo estos pasos, podrá raspar y procesar datos de IMDb utilizando `BeautifulSoup` en Python, y transformarlos en datos tabulares para análisis y uso en proyectos futuros."

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and\\nBabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond\\ngenerating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed\\nas a powerful general problem solver. # Agent System Overview# In a LLM-\\npowered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent\\'s brain,\\ncomplemented by several key components: * **Planning** * Subgoal and\\ndecomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable\\nsubgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks. * Reflection and\\nrefinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past\\nactions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby\\nimproving the quality of final results. * **Memory** * Short-term memory: I\\nwould consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as\\nutilizing short-term memory of the model to learn. * Long-term memory: This\\nprovides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite)\\ninformation over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector\\nstore and fast retrieval. * **Tool use** * The agent learns to call external\\nAPIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard\\nto change after pre-training), including current information, code execution\\ncapability, access to proprietary information sources and more. Fig. 1.\\nOverview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system. # Component One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what\\nthey are and plan ahead. ## Task Decomposition# **Chain of thought** (CoT; Wei\\net al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model\\nperformance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to \"think step by step\"\\nto utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and\\nsimpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and\\nshed lights into an interpretation of the model\\'s thinking process. **Tree of\\nThoughts** (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning\\npossibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple\\nthought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree\\nstructure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-\\nfirst search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or\\nmajority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting\\nlike `\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\"`, `\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\"`, (2)\\nby using task-specific instructions; e.g. `\"Write a story outline.\"` for\\nwriting a novel, or (3) with human inputs. Another quite distinct approach,\\n**LLM+P** (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner\\nto do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain\\nDefinition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the\\nplanning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into\\n\"Problem PDDL\", then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan\\nbased on an existing \"Domain PDDL\", and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan\\nback into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an\\nexternal tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a\\nsuitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many\\nother domains. ## Self-Reflection# Self-reflection is a vital aspect that\\nallows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action\\ndecisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-\\nworld tasks where trial and error are inevitable. **ReAct** (Yao et al. 2023)\\nintegrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be\\na combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The\\nformer enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search\\nAPI), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural\\nlanguage. The ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to\\nthink, roughly formatted as: Thought: ... Action: ... Observation: ... ...\\n(Repeated many times) Fig. 2. Examples of reasoning trajectories for\\nknowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks\\n(e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023). In both\\nexperiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, `ReAct`\\nworks better than the `Act`-only baseline where `Thought: …` step is removed.\\n**Reflexion** (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with\\ndynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.\\nReflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple\\nbinary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-\\nspecific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning\\nsteps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and\\noptionally may _decide to reset_ the environment to start a new trial\\ndepending on the self-reflection results. Fig. 3. Illustration of the\\nReflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023) The heuristic\\nfunction determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains\\nhallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to\\ntrajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as\\nencountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same\\nobservation in the environment. Self-reflection is created by showing two-shot\\nexamples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal\\nreflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added\\ninto the agent\\'s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for\\nquerying LLM. Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination\\nis a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source:\\nShinn & Labash, 2023) **Chain of Hindsight** (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages\\nthe model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a\\nsequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is\\na collection of $D_h = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where\\n$x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating\\nof $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback.\\nAssume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots\\n\\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence\\nin the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where\\n$\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where\\nconditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to\\nproduce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally\\nreceive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time. To\\navoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-\\nlikelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying\\n(because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly\\nmask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training. The training dataset in their\\nexperiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human\\nfeedback and human preference dataset. Fig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the\\nmodel can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement\\nin a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023) The idea of CoH is to present a\\nhistory of sequentially improved outputs in context and train the model to\\ntake on the trend to produce better outputs. **Algorithm Distillation** (AD;\\nLaskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in\\nreinforcement learning tasks, where an _algorithm_ is encapsulated in a long\\nhistory-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the\\nenvironment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD\\nconcatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we\\nshould expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than\\nprevious trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a\\ntask-specific policy itself. Fig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm\\nDistillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023). The paper\\nhypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can\\nbe distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over\\nactions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each\\ntrained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a\\nrandom task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for\\ntraining, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic. In reality, the model\\nhas limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to\\nconstruct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are\\nnecessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of\\nin-context RL requires long enough context. In comparison with three\\nbaselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert\\ntrajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating\\ntrajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper\\nbound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with\\nperformance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns\\nmuch faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history\\nof the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline. Fig. 7.\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require\\nmemory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies\\nare trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze. (Image\\nsource: Laskin et al. 2023) # Component Two: Memory# (Big thank you to ChatGPT\\nfor helping me draft this section. I\\'ve learned a lot about the human brain\\nand data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.) ## Types\\nof Memory# Memory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store,\\nretain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in\\nhuman brains. 1\\\\\\\\. **Sensory Memory** : This is the earliest stage of memory,\\nproviding the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual,\\nauditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically\\nonly lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory\\n(visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch). 2\\\\\\\\. **Short-\\nTerm Memory** (STM) or **Working Memory** : It stores information that we are\\ncurrently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as\\nlearning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of\\nabout 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds. 3\\\\\\\\. **Long-Term\\nMemory** (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long\\ntime, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited\\nstorage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM: * Explicit / declarative\\nmemory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that\\ncan be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and\\nexperiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts). * Implicit / procedural\\nmemory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines\\nthat are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory. We can roughly consider the following\\nmappings: * Sensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw\\ninputs, including text, image or other modalities; * Short-term memory as in-\\ncontext learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite\\ncontext window length of Transformer. * Long-term memory as the external\\nvector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast\\nretrieval. ## Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)# The external memory can\\nalleviate the restriction of finite attention span. A standard practice is to\\nsave the embedding representation of information into a vector store database\\nthat can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the\\nretrieval speed, the common choice is the _approximate nearest neighbors\\n(ANN)\\u200b_ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off\\na little accuracy lost for a huge speedup. A couple common choices of ANN\\nalgorithms for fast MIPS: * **LSH** (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It\\nintroduces a _hashing_ function such that similar input items are mapped to\\nthe same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much\\nsmaller than the number of inputs. * **ANNOY** (Approximate Nearest Neighbors\\nOh Yeah): The core data structure are _random projection trees_ , a set of\\nbinary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the\\ninput space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built\\nindependently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function.\\nANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half\\nthat is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is\\nquite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable. * **HNSW** (Hierarchical\\nNavigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks\\nwhere most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of\\nsteps; e.g. \"six degrees of separation\" feature of social networks. HNSW\\nbuilds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom\\nlayers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create\\nshortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a\\nrandom node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can\\'t\\nget any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom\\nlayer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in\\nthe data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\n* **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption\\nthat in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian\\ndistribution and thus there should exist _clustering_ of data points. FAISS\\napplies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and\\nthen refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster\\ncandidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster\\nwith finer quantization. * **ScaNN** (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main\\ninnovation in ScaNN is _anisotropic vector quantization_. It quantizes a data\\npoint $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i\\n\\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as\\npossible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points. Fig. 9.\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize\\nexternal objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive\\nlimits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model\\ncapabilities. Fig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a\\nseashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools,\\nthe complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using\\ntools) **MRKL** (Karpas et al. 2022), short for \"Modular Reasoning, Knowledge\\nand Language\", is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL\\nsystem is proposed to contain a collection of \"expert\" modules and the\\ngeneral-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable\\nexpert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or\\nsymbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API). They did an\\nexperiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test\\ncase. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math\\nproblems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large\\nmodel) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic\\nreliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work\\nreliably, _knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial_ , determined\\nby the LLM capability. Both **TALM** (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi\\net al. 2022) and **Toolformer** (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn\\nto use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly\\nadded API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more\\ndetails in the \"External APIs\" section of Prompt Engineering. ChatGPT Plugins\\nand OpenAI API function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool\\nuse capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be\\nprovided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function\\ncalls). **HuggingGPT** (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the\\ntask planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to\\nthe model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution\\nresults. Fig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et\\nal. 2023) The system comprises of 4 stages: **(1) Task planning** : LLM works\\nas the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four\\nattributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and\\narguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and\\nplanning. Instruction: The AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks:\\n[{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\":\\ntext, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the\\nid of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task\\nrelies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio\\nand video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected\\nfrom the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical\\nrelationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t\\nbe parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your\\nreference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat\\nHistory }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-\\nmentioned resources for your task planning. **(2) Model selection** : LLM\\ndistributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a\\nmultiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose\\nfrom. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction: Given the user request and the call command, the AI assistant\\nhelps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the\\nuser request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most\\nappropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\",\\n\"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for\\nyou to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the\\nlist. **(3) Task execution** : Expert models execute on the specific tasks and\\nlog results. Instruction: With the input and the inference results, the AI\\nassistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can\\nbe formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model\\nSelection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must\\nfirst answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the\\ntask process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in\\nthe first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user\\nthe complete file path. **(4) Response generation** : LLM receives the\\nexecution results and provides summarized results to users. To put HuggingGPT\\ninto real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency\\nimprovement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other\\nmodels slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to\\ncommunicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM\\noutputs and external model services. **API-Bank** (Li et al. 2023) is a\\nbenchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains\\n53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool- augmented LLM workflow, and 264\\nannotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite\\ndiverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home\\ncontrol, schedule management, health data management, account authentication\\nworkflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has\\naccess to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the\\ncorresponding documentation to make a call. Fig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM\\nmakes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023) In the API-Bank\\nworkflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can\\nevaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include: 1\\\\\\\\. Whether an API\\ncall is needed. 2\\\\\\\\. Identify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs\\nneed to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for\\nSearch Engine API). 3\\\\\\\\. Response based on the API results: the model can\\nchoose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied. This benchmark\\nevaluates the agent\\'s tool use capabilities at three levels: * Level-1\\nevaluates the ability to _call the API_. Given an API\\'s description, the model\\nneeds to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond\\nproperly to API returns. * Level-2 examines the ability to _retrieve the API_.\\nThe model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user\\'s\\nrequirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation. * Level-3\\nassesses the ability to _plan API beyond retrieve and call_. Given unclear\\nuser requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for\\na trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it. # Case\\nStudies# ## Scientific Discovery Agent# **ChemCrow** (Bran et al. 2023) is a\\ndomain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed\\ntools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and\\nmaterials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was\\npreviously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with\\ntools relevant to the tasks: * The LLM is provided with a list of tool names,\\ndescriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output. *\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided\\nwhen necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format\\n\\\\- `Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation`. One interesting observation\\nis that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow\\nperform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards\\nthe completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow\\noutperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with\\nusing LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep\\nexpertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus\\ncannot well judge the correctness of task results. Boiko et al. (2023) also\\nlooked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle\\nautonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific\\nexperiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read\\ndocumentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage\\nother LLMs. For example, when requested to `\"develop a novel anticancer\\ndrug\"`, the model came up with the following reasoning steps: 1\\\\\\\\. inquired\\nabout current trends in anticancer drug discovery; 2\\\\\\\\. selected a target;\\n3\\\\\\\\. requested a scaffold targeting these compounds; 4\\\\\\\\. Once the compound\\nwas identified, the model attempted its synthesis. They also discussed the\\nrisks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set\\ncontaining a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to\\nsynthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a\\nsynthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute\\nthe procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5\\nhappened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only. ##\\nGenerative Agents Simulation# **Generative Agents** (Park, et al. 2023) is\\nsuper fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-\\npowered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired\\nby The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior\\nfor interactive applications. The design of generative agents combines LLM\\nwith memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave\\nconditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents. *\\n**Memory** stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that\\nrecords a comprehensive list of agents\\' experience in natural language. * Each\\nelement is an _observation_ , an event directly provided by the agent. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-\\nInter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements. *\\n**Retrieval** model: surfaces the context to inform the agent\\'s behavior,\\naccording to relevance, recency and importance. * Recency: recent events have\\nhigher scores * Importance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM\\ndirectly. * Relevance: based on how related it is to the current situation /\\nquery. * **Reflection** mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level\\ninferences over time and guides the agent\\'s future behavior. They are _higher-\\nlevel summaries of past events_ (<\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- note that this is a bit different from\\nself-reflection above) * Prompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to\\ngenerate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of\\nobservations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions. * **Planning &\\nReacting**: translate the reflections and the environment information into\\nactions * Planning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the\\nmoment vs in time. * Prompt template: `{Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan\\ntoday in broad strokes: 1)` * Relationships between agents and observations of\\none agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and\\nreacting. * Environment information is present in a tree structure. Fig. 13.\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023) This fun\\nsimulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,\\nrelationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and\\ncoordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others). ##\\nProof-of-Concept Examples# AutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the\\npossibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.\\nIt has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface,\\nbut nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to\\nwork with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-\\nreflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or\\ninfinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide\\naccess to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as\\npowerful as full attention. * **Challenges in long-term planning and task\\ndecomposition** : Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring\\nthe solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when\\nfaced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who\\nlearn from trial and error. * **Reliability of natural language interface** :\\nCurrent agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs\\nand external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of\\nmodel outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and\\noccasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an\\ninstruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing\\nmodel output. # Citation# Cited as: > Weng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). LLM-powered\\nAutonomous Agents\".
